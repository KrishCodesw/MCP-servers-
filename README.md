The main.js file is an example of a local MCP server which understands the context of a Weather data which is hardcorded by me I have not used any external api for the data yet but it is really simple to do so and
also it has STDIOserver transport so it is only available offline , to make it available online we need to use SSE with an express server so that it is hosted locally and the api part is also connected 
You can use this as a starter point to create MCP - SERVERS
